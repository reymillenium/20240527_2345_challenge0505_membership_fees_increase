# COP 1334 Assignment - Introduction to C++

## Chapter 5: Challenge 5

## Title: Membership Fees Increase

### Exercise Description:

A country club, which currently charges $2,500 per year for membership, has announced it will increase its membership fee by 4 percent each year for the next 6 years. Write a program that uses a loop to display the projected rates for the next 6 years.

## Execution from the Terminal (Alternative way without an IDE):

A country club, which currently charges $2,500 per year for membership, has announced it will increase its membership fee by 4 percent each year for the next 6 years. Write a program that uses a loop to display the projected rates for the next 6 years.

```terminal
g++ -Wall -std=c++17 main.cpp
```

That will create a file named 'a.out' if you are working in MacOS or a .exe file if you are on Windows. That's the default executable file's name when we don't provide a name.

But we can also specify the name of the resulting executable file:

```terminal
g++ -Wall -std=c++17 main.cpp -o your_prefered_executable_file_name
```

And in order to run that a.out file, we must execute on the terminal:

```terminal
 % ./a.out
```

## Result of Execution on the Terminal (MacOS example):

```terminal
reinier@reinier % ./your_prefered_executable_file_name
